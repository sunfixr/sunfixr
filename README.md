Making the world a better place by helping to maintain, and sustain rural solar micro grids.

Hundreds of rural microgrids have been installed in the last decade.  Installers come in and do a great job installing 
the grid for small remote rural villages, and then ... leave. Sunfixr is a project to educate and empower a local corps of 
"SunFixers" to maintain these vital assets.

The idea is to bring together a repository of information about each of these "projects" including manuals, schematics, work logs,
and photographs, with a training site (think Kahn Academy) and Q/A expert forum (like stackoverflow.com).   

This project was born out of a solar industry "Hackathon" held at sFunCube in Oakland:
